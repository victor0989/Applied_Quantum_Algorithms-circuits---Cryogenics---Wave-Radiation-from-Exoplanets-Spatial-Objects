Fig. 6. Determination of the ratio between typical durations of Ganymede-Jupiter, Io-Jupiter, and non-Io emissions. Histograms of rescaled
Ganymede-Jupiter event durations by a factor are displayed for six representative values of– indicated above each panel– among those
studied (0.5 2.0, by steps of 0.1). On all panels, the red dashed (resp. blue dotted) histogram is the normalized distribution of durations
of Io-Jupiter (resp. non-Io) emission events, similar to the black dashed and dotted histograms of Fig. 4b. The black solid line is the normalized
distribution of rescaled durations of Ganymede-Jupiter events. Thin solid red (resp. blue) lines are the bin-to-bin ratio of the rescaled Ganymede
Jupiter histogram to the Io-Jupiter (resp. non-Io) one, over the range 20-180 minutes. Boldface straight lines are the degree 1 (lin-log) fit of the
thin lines of corresponding colour, whose slopes are indicated at the top of the plots.
Io’s ionosphere (Robs 11 RIo)orGanymede’smagnetosphere
(Robs 
25 RGa). Using the measured parameter values from
Table 21.1 of Kivelson et al. (2004), one finally obtains the ratios
< Pkin(Io)Pkin(Ga) > 5 (with a large variability between 3
and 200 around this average value) and < Pmag(Io)Pmag(Ga) >
17 (with a lower variability between 10 and 40 around this
average value). The observed ratio between the I-J and G-J radio
powers, found to be 15 above, is therefore consistent with the
ratio of the magnetic energy (Poynting) fluxes intercepted by Io
and Ganymede.
